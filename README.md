# tic_tac_toe_cpp
Tic tac toe terminal game developed using c++.

Built a tic tac toe terminal app using c++, per a codecademy project. Was proud enough of it — at least at this point in my c++ learning, lol — that I wanted to show it off.

## Compile Step
If you have g++ installed you can access the top level directory and call g++ main.cpp game_functions.cpp -o tic_tac_toe to build the executable from the source. I left the executable to make it easy for people to access.
